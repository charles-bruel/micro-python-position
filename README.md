# micro-python-position

So this was a thing I made for a school project and never fully finished. It is supposed to keep track of the position of a lego mindstorms bot and navigate based on it. The code is bad and doesn't work great but I am putting here just have it. Do whatever you want with it, I don't care.

The existing routines were for playing the trash trek game. I was making more complex routes but had to abandon them as the due date approached.

The speed of the robot was the primary issue, as the navigation relied on having a slow movement. Combining multiple tasks into one routine would help but speed improvements would be required to complete all planned objectives within 2.5 minutes.

This was an interesting expirement into ev3 micropython and I think there is a bunch of other cool stuff you could do with it.
